## ✅ **Bug Fix 1: Critical Issues Not Showing**

### **Problem:**
Scan results showed "No critical issues found" even when vulnerabilities existed.

### **Solution:**
Enhanced detection logic to check:
- ✅ `vulnerable` flag in scan results
- ✅ `risk_level` === 'CRITICAL' or 'HIGH'
- ✅ All vulnerabilities array
- ✅ All issues array
- ✅ Sensitive files found
- ✅ Admin panels discovered

### **Now Detects:**
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities
- XSS findings
- Exposed sensitive files (.env, .git, backups)
- Accessible admin panels
- Security misconfigurations
- Any HIGH/CRITICAL severity items

**Result:** Users now see actual critical issues when they exist!

## ✅ **Bug Fix 2: Download Button Not Working**

### **Problem:**
Clicking download button didn't show payment modal.

### **Root Cause:**
Button was being disabled if `report_available` was false.

### **Solution:**
- ✅ Always enable download button
- ✅ Button always shows payment modal
- ✅ Payment modal handles access control
- ✅ Users can always attempt to get report

**Result:** Download button now works every time!
