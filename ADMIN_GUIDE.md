## Data Storage

### Scan Storage System

Scan data is stored in a JSON file at `data/scans.json`. The storage system:

- Automatically creates the storage file if it doesn't exist
- Stores complete scan results including metadata
- Maintains up to 1000 most recent scans
- Provides fast search and retrieval
- Thread-safe for concurrent operations

### Storage Structure

```json
{
  "scans": [
    {
      "scan_id": "abc123",
      "target": "https://example.com",
      "scan_type": "full",
      "security_score": 85,
      "risk_level": "LOW",
      "start_time": "2025-10-12T10:30:00",
      "end_time": "2025-10-12T10:31:00",
      "duration": 45.3,
      "status": "completed",
      "created_at": "2025-10-12T10:31:00",
      "results_summary": {...},
      "full_results": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

   - JSON-based persistence
   - CRUD operations
   - Search and statistics functions

2. **app.py**: Flask application with admin routes

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The admin dashboard currently has no authentication. In a production environment, you should:

1. Add authentication middleware
2. Implement role-based access control
3. Add CSRF protection
4. Use HTTPS
5. Implement rate limiting
6. Add audit logging

Example authentication setup:
```python
from functools import wraps
from flask import session, redirect

def admin_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        if not session.get('is_admin'):
            return redirect('/login')
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function

@app.route('/admin')
@admin_required
def admin_page():
    return send_from_directory('static', 'admin.html')
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No scans showing in dashboard
- Ensure at least one scan has been completed
- Check that `data/scans.json` exists and is readable
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Statistics not loading
- Verify the `/api/admin/statistics` endpoint is accessible
- Check server logs for errors
- Ensure scan storage is properly initialized

### Issue: Cannot delete scans
- Check file permissions on `data/scans.json` and `reports/` directory
- Verify the scan ID exists
- Check server logs for errors

### Issue: Modal not closing
- Press ESC key
- Click outside the modal area
- Refresh the page
